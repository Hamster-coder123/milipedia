# Hermes Agent Change Log

## Schedule

* Branch: hermes-agent
* Run frequency: once every hour
* Duration: 2 weeks
* Maximum runs: 336
* Start date: 2026-06-29
* End date: 2026-07-13

### Run 1 — 2026-06-29 18:52:13 UTC

#### Branch

hermes-agent

#### Selected Page

* File: data/aircraft.json
* Aircraft/Page: Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird (id: sr-71-blackbird)
* Reason selected: The generated SR-71 page was much sparser than the F-16 reference page, with only three generic footnotes, no real operators or variants, no detailed specifications beyond broad placeholders, and generic armament text that incorrectly implied weapons.
* Previous condition: Placeholder-like generated entry with 15 exact fact fields, 0 operator entries, 0 variant entries, 0 external article sources, missing detailed development/design/operators/timeline content, missing official sources, and generic "gun/missile/external stores" wording inappropriate for an unarmed reconnaissance aircraft.
* Previously edited by Hermes: No

#### Reference Page Used

* F-16 page file path: data/f16-template.html
* Formatting patterns copied: Lead overview with dense fact groups; article-section ordering; concise sourced paragraphs; specifications-first technical phrasing; variants, operators, operational history, notable events, comparison, strengths/limitations, timeline, sources, and related-links coverage; neutral caveats for uncertain or overbroad public claims; internal aircraft link style using aircraft.html?id=...

#### Changes Made

* Expanded the SR-71 entry in data/aircraft.json from a sparse generated page into a fuller Milipedia article data record.
* Corrected top-level facts: manufacturer as Lockheed Skunk Works, role as long-range high-altitude strategic reconnaissance, retirement status, number built, engines, range, ceiling, no-weapons armament, and related aircraft.
* Replaced generic gun/missile armament language with accurate unarmed reconnaissance wording.
* Added official/reference sources from the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, NASA Dryden, Lockheed Martin, and a supplementary Wikipedia orientation source.
* Added/expanded sections for Overview, Development History, Design and Capabilities, Specifications, Variants, Operators, Operational History, Notable Events and Records, Public Perception, Comparison, Strengths and Limitations, Timeline, and Related Pages.
* Added verified technical details for first flight, service entry, retirement, J58 engines, Mach 3+ speed, range, ceiling, dimensions, loaded weight, 1976 speed/altitude records, and NASA research use.
* Added USAF and NASA operator coverage.
* Added Blackbird-family variants and related aircraft: A-12, YF-12A, SR-71A, SR-71B, and SR-71C.
* Added public-perception caveats to avoid overstating "invulnerable" or fighter-like claims.
* Added internal link to the existing Lockheed U-2 page and a database return link.
* Omitted unsupported details about exact mission sensor packages because configurations varied by aircraft, period, and mission.

#### Files Modified

* data/aircraft.json — Expanded the SR-71 Blackbird aircraft page data and sources.
* hermes-change-log.md — Created the cumulative Hermes run log and recorded this run.

#### Verification Checklist

* [x] Branch hermes-agent was used
* [x] Main branch was not edited directly
* [x] Repository was fetched before edits
* [x] Selected page was relatively empty before editing
* [x] Page had not already been substantially updated by Hermes
* [x] F-16 page was used as formatting reference
* [x] Updated page matches Milipedia style
* [x] No unrelated files were changed
* [x] No secrets or credentials were added
* [x] Internal links were checked
* [x] Formatting was checked
* [x] The page was reviewed for missing sections
* [x] The final diff was reviewed before commit
* [x] Change log was updated for this run

#### Verification Steps Completed

Record the result of:
1. git status — Before commit, only data/aircraft.json and hermes-change-log.md were intended modified files.
2. git diff — Reviewed diff/stat; data/aircraft.json changed only the SR-71 entry, and hermes-change-log.md was newly created.
3. File review — Parsed data/aircraft.json with python3 -m json.tool; reviewed the SR-71 entry section list, footnotes, armament correction, and article quality fields.
4. F-16 style comparison — Inspected data/f16-template.html and copied its dense lead, section order, sourced paragraph style, specifications emphasis, comparison, timeline, sources, and related-page patterns within the JSON-rendered article system.
5. Internal link check — Verified aircraft.html?id=u-2-dragon-lady points to an existing aircraft id in data/aircraft.json; external reference URLs retained as source links.
6. Secret/token check — Ran grep over the intended diff for API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, and credential patterns. Matches for ordinary words such as "secret" in historical prose were reviewed as false positives; no credentials were added.
7. Final review before commit — Confirmed branch hermes-agent, JSON validity, changed files, SR-71 section coverage, and no main-branch edits.

#### Commit

* Commit message: Hermes hourly update: expand Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird
* Commit hash: Pending until commit is created; final hash is reported in the run output.

#### Issues or Uncertainties

* Commit hash cannot be embedded in the committed change log without changing the commit hash again; the final hash is reported in the scheduled-run response.
* Some SR-71 mission sensor details vary by aircraft, period, and mission, so exact sensor package tables were intentionally omitted.
* The rendered data-driven page is less visually bespoke than the static F-16 template, but it now follows the same article order and density available within data/aircraft.json.

### Run 2 — 2026-06-29 19:03:33 UTC

#### Branch

hermes-agent

#### Selected Page

* File: data/aircraft.json
* Aircraft/Page: Boeing P-8 Poseidon (id: p-8-poseidon)
* Reason selected: The generated P-8 page was one of the sparsest unedited aircraft entries, with only generic Wikipedia/Wikidata/method sources, no real operators or variants, missing dimensions/range/ceiling/engine detail, and generic fighter-style armament text.
* Previous condition: Placeholder-like generated entry with 15 exact fact fields, 0 operator entries, 0 variant entries, 0 external article sources, generic "gun/air-to-air missiles/external stores" wording, sparse specifications, and short generated sections.
* Previously edited by Hermes: No

#### Reference Page Used

* F-16 page file path: data/f16-template.html
* Formatting patterns copied: Dense overview; article-section ordering from overview through development, design, specifications, variants, operators, operational history, comparison, strengths/limitations, timeline, sources, and related links; short sourced paragraphs; card-style key facts; internal aircraft.html?id=... links; cautious notes where public facts vary by variant, operator, or upgrade increment.

#### Changes Made

* Expanded the P-8 Poseidon entry in data/aircraft.json into a fuller Milipedia article data record while keeping the existing JSON-rendered page structure.
* Corrected top-level facts for manufacturer, role, aircraft type, first flight, U.S. Navy IOC, engines, maximum speed, range/station time, service ceiling, mission stores, and summary text.
* Replaced misleading generic gun/air-to-air missile wording with P-8-specific public mission-store language: Mk 54 torpedoes, Harpoon, sonobuoys, and search-and-rescue stores, with a caution that loadouts vary.
* Added official/manufacturer sources from Boeing and NAVAIR, retained Wikipedia as supplementary orientation only, and kept the Milipedia accuracy-rules source.
* Added/expanded sections for Overview, Development History, Design and Capabilities, Specifications, Variants, Operators, Operational History, Notable Events and Program Milestones, Comparison, Strengths and Limitations, Timeline, Sources and Notes, and Related Pages.
* Added verified technical details for CFM56-7BE engines, 27,300 lb thrust per engine, 123.6 ft wingspan, about 129.5-129.6 ft length, 42.1 ft height, 189,200 lb maximum gross takeoff weight, 490-knot maximum speed, 41,000 ft ceiling, and 1,200+ nmi plus 4+ hours on station.
* Added operator/customer coverage for the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, India, Norway, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Germany, Canada, and Singapore where supported by Boeing/public sources, with delivery-status caveats.
* Added variant coverage for P-8A, P-8I Neptune, and Increment 3 Block 2 upgrade context.
* Added related internal links to Lockheed P-3 Orion and Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk, plus the database return link.
* Removed the sparse generated Syrian civil war event gallery from the P-8 entry because it was not useful for this maritime patrol page and could imply conflict-specific certainty not supported by the new official-source framing.
* Omitted exact current fleet totals, detailed mission-system configuration tables, and operator-specific weapons clearances because those facts change by delivery status, upgrade increment, and national configuration.

#### Files Modified

* data/aircraft.json — Expanded only the Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft page data and sources.
* hermes-change-log.md — Appended the cumulative Run 2 log entry.

#### Verification Steps Completed

Record the result of:
1. git status — Before commit, only data/aircraft.json and hermes-change-log.md were intended modified files.
2. git diff — Reviewed diff/stat; data/aircraft.json changes are limited to the P-8 Poseidon entry, and hermes-change-log.md adds this Run 2 entry.
3. File review — Parsed data/aircraft.json with python3 -m json.tool; reviewed P-8 sections, footnotes, article quality fields, event_gallery cleanup, and corrected armament wording.
4. F-16 style comparison — Inspected data/f16-template.html and copied its dense lead, section order, sourced paragraphs, specifications emphasis, variants/operators/service/comparison/timeline coverage, source notes, and related-page patterns within the JSON article system.
5. Internal link check — Verified aircraft.html?id=p-3-orion and aircraft.html?id=rq-4-global-hawk target existing aircraft ids in data/aircraft.json; external Boeing 737 link is intentionally external.
6. Secret/token check — Ran credential-specific scan over the staged diff for API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, GitHub tokens, and AWS credentials; no credentials were added.
7. Final review before commit — Confirmed branch hermes-agent, JSON validity, diff check, intended files only, P-8 was not previously edited by Hermes, and no main-branch edits.

#### Commit

* Commit message: Hermes hourly update: expand Boeing P-8 Poseidon
* Commit hash: Pending until commit is created; final hash is reported in the run output.

#### Issues or Uncertainties

* Commit hash cannot be embedded in the committed change log without changing the commit hash again; the final hash is reported in the scheduled-run response.
* Boeing and public reference pages use evolving delivery/customer language, so exact current fleet totals and delivery status by operator were intentionally not made into fixed force-count tables.
* Exact P-8 mission-system fits and weapons clearances vary by operator and upgrade increment; the page uses cautious public-source wording instead of unsupported configuration tables.
